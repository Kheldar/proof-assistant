proof-assistant
===============

A proof assistant for natural deduction in propositional logic.


Compilation
------------

Compile src/Solver.java, and then run the .class file as normal.
Alternatively, load the whole project in Eclipse and let it sort it out.

Usage
------------
The program takes a single formula as its input, which it will then attempt to prove. 
A grammar may be found in src/parser/grammar.txt, and should be reasonably self-explainatory.
